Source code available from the PRMS web page (http://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/prms).
The Windows and Linux executables are built from exactly the same source code.

Windows

The Windows distribution executable was built using Windows Visual Studio 2010
and Intel Parallel Studio XE 2011. The fortran and C source files are each
set up as their own projects. The fortran project is created as an "app." and
the C project is a static library. The fortran project depends on the C
project.

Linux

The Linux distribution executable was built on 64-bit Linux
using GNU gcc and gfortran. The makefiles are included with the source
code. Edit the "MOWSDIR" variable in the "makelist" file to point to the
location of the source code top level directory. Run make here.
